# grimfable-rpg
A single-player fantasy text based RPG. The game is built with and uses Quest to run, and is coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Quest is a text-adventure engine that can run in the browser, and there is a desktop application that uses Google Chrome to run locally.
You can get Quest at the official site:
http://textadventures.co.uk/

The .quest file here needs the desktop application to run, which I recommend. If you want to play the game in the browser, you can do so here:
